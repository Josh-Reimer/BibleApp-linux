5:8: Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.
John
5:13: And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.
John
5:14: Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.
John
5:15: The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.
John
5:16: And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.
John
5:17: But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.
John
5:19: Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.
John
6:1: After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.
John
6:3: And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.
John
6:5: When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?
John
6:10: And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.
John
6:11: And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.
John
6:14: Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.
John
6:15: When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.
John
6:17: And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.
John
6:19: So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid.
John
6:22: The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;
John
6:24: When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.
John
6:26: Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.
John
6:29: Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.
John
6:32: Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.
John
6:35: And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.
John
6:42: And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?
John
6:43: Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.
John
6:53: Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.
John
6:61: When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you?
John
6:64: But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.
John
6:67: Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?
John
6:70: Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?
John
7:1: After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.
John
7:6: Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.
John
7:14: Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.
John
7:16: Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.
John
7:21: Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.
John
7:28: Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.
John
7:33: Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me.
John
7:37: In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.
John
7:39: (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)
John
7:50: Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)
John
8:1: Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.
John
8:6: This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.
John
8:9: And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.
John
8:10: When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?
John
8:11: She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.
John
8:12: Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
John
8:14: Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.
John
8:19: Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.
John
8:20: These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.
John
8:21: Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.
John
8:25: Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.
John
8:28: Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.
John
8:31: Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;
John
8:34: Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.
John
8:39: They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.
John
8:42: Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.
John
8:49: Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.
John
8:54: Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:
John
8:58: Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.
John
8:59: Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.
John
9:1: And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.
John
9:3: Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.
John
9:11: He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.
John
9:14: And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.
John
9:35: Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?
John
9:37: And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.
John
9:39: And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.
John
9:41: Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.
John
10:6: This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.
John
10:7: Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.
John
10:23: And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.
John
10:25: Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.
John
10:32: Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?
John
10:34: Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?
John
11:4: When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.
John
11:5: Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
John
11:9: Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.
John
11:13: Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.
John
11:14: Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.
John
11:17: Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.
John
11:20: Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.
John
11:21: Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
John
11:23: Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.
John
11:25: Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:
John
11:30: Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.
John
11:32: Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
John
11:33: When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,
John
11:35: Jesus wept.
John
11:38: Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.
John
11:39: Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days.
John
11:40: Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?
John
11:41: Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.
John
11:44: And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.
John
11:45: Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.
John
11:46: But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.
John
11:51: And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;
John
11:54: Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.
John
11:56: Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?
John
12:1: Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.
John
12:3: Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.
John
12:7: Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.
John
12:9: Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.
John
12:11: Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.
John
12:12: On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
John
12:14: And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,
John
12:16: These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.
John
12:21: The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.
John
12:22: Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.
John
12:23: And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.
John
12:30: Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.
John
12:35: Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.
John
12:36: While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.
John
12:44: Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.
John
13:1: Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.
John
13:3: Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;
John
13:7: Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.
John
13:8: Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.
John
13:10: Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.
John
13:21: When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.
John
13:23: Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.
John
13:25: He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?
John
13:26: Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.
John
13:27: And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly.
John
13:29: For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.
John
13:31: Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.
John
13:36: Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards.
John
13:38: Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.
John
14:6: Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.
John
14:9: Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?
John
14:23: Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.
John
16:19: Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?
John
16:31: Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?
John
17:1: These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee:
John
17:3: And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.
John
18:1: When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.
John
18:2: And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.
John
18:4: Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?
John
18:5: They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.
John
18:7: Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.
John
18:8: Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:
John
18:11: Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?
John
18:12: Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,
John
18:15: And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.
John
18:19: The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.
John
18:20: Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.
John
18:22: And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?
John
18:23: Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?
John
18:28: Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.
John
18:32: That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.
John
18:33: Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?
John
18:34: Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?
John
18:36: Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.
John
18:37: Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.
John
19:1: Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.
John
19:5: Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!
John
19:9: And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.
John
19:11: Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.
John
19:13: When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.
John
19:16: Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.
John
19:18: Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.
John
19:19: And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.
John
19:20: This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.
John
19:23: Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
John
19:25: Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.
John
19:26: When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!
John
19:28: After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.
John
19:30: When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.
John
19:33: But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:
John
19:38: And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.
John
19:39: And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.
John
19:40: Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.
John
19:42: There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.
John
20:2: Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.
John
20:12: And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
John
20:14: And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.
John
20:15: Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.
John
20:16: Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.
John
20:17: Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.
John
20:19: Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.
John
20:21: Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.
John
20:24: But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.
John
20:26: And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.
John
20:29: Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.
John
20:30: And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:
John
20:31: But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.
John
21:1: After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself.
John
21:4: But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.
John
21:5: Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No.
John
21:7: Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.
John
21:10: Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.
John
21:12: Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.
John
21:13: Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.
John
21:14: This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.
John
21:15: So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.
John
21:17: He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.
John
21:20: Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?
John
21:21: Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?
John
21:22: Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.
John
21:23: Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?
John
21:25: And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.Acts
